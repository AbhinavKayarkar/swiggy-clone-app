        In 2011, Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy designed an e-commerce
        website called Bundl to facilitate courier service and shipping within
        India.[6] Bundl was halted in 2014 and rebranded to enter the food
        delivery market.[7] Majety and Reddy approached Rahul Jaimini, formerly
        with Myntra, and founded Swiggy in August 2014.[8][6][7] 
        By 2015, Swiggy
        expanded its food delivery operations from just Bengaluru to eight Tier
        1 cities across India.[9][10] At the time, the food delivery sector was
        in turmoil as several notable startups, such as Foodpanda (later
        acquired by Ola Cabs), TinyOwl (later acquired by Zomato) and Ola Cafe
        (later closed) were struggling.[6][7] In January 2017, Swiggy started
        its cloud kitchen chain called "The Bowl Company".[11] In November 2017,
        Swiggy started a kitchen incubator business called Swiggy Access,
        opening a network of ready-to-occupy kitchens for its restaurant
        partners.[12] By 2019, over 1,000 Swiggy Access kitchens were
        operational, according to a TechCrunch report.[13] In mid-2018, Swiggy
        was operational in 16 Indian cities,[14] which increased to 500 cities
        in 2019, matching the scale of rival Zomato.[15] In early 2019, Swiggy
        expanded into general product deliveries under the name Swiggy Stores,
        sourcing items from local stores.[16][17][18] In September 2019, Swiggy
        launched the instant pickup/dropoff service Swiggy Go, allowing
        customers to send document or parcel deliveries.[19][20] In April 2020,
        it rebranded Swiggy Go as Swiggy Genie.[21] During the COVID-19
        pandemic, it began doorstep delivery of alcohol in the states of
        Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha.[22][23] In May 2020, Swiggy laid off
        1,100 employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.[24] The pandemic also
        resulted in the shut down of more than three-fourths of its cloud
        kitchens.[25] A Swiggy delivery partner swapping the battery of his

        delivery service called Instamart using a network of dark
        stores.[26][27] In early 2021, the company closed Swiggy Stores and
        expanded its operations under Instamart.[28] In 2023, it sold Swiggy
        Access kitchens to Kitchens@ in a share-swap deal.[29] In January 2024,
        Swiggy laid off 400 employees, or 6% of its workforce, ahead of
        IPO.[30][31] In April 2024, Swiggy converted itself into a public
        limited company[32] and confidentially filed for an initial public
        offering.[33] Swiggy launched its initial public offering (IPO) in
        November 2024 at â‚¹390 per share, valuing the company at $11.3
        billion.[34]
